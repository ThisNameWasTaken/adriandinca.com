I developed this theme gradually over the past year using [One Dark](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax) as a starting point. I began this project because, at the time, One Dark did not support C++ and I did find myself opening C++ in VS Code quite a lot.

After adding basic support for C++, I started playing with colors until I got a color pallette which I found easier on the eyes while still maintaining that flat and clean look of One Dark. Meanwhile I improved various aspects of the theme regarding styles' consistency across different languages.
